<h1><b>Wildfire Modeling in the Wildland-Urban Interface</b></h1>

<h1>I. Introduction</h1>

<p>In October of 1991, a firestorm tore through the hills

of Berkeley and Oakland, CA, leaving 1,800 homes, 2000

vehicles and 14 people in its wake (1).   The event was the

worst fire in CA history and provided a harsh reminder of the

risk of fire in Mediterranean climates, especially in the

Wildland Urban Interface (WUI).  The Oakland fire

highlighted the dangers of fire suppression and a history of

fire mitigation that ignored the natural processes of

Mediterranean ecosystems.  Whether this involved the

introduction of invasive species, the construction of dense

housing developments, or the inability to conduct large scale

controlled burns, the legacy of these outcomes have proven

time and time again that these fire suppression strategies

are a disaster waiting to happen (2).  There is a clear need for alternative methods to mitigate the risk of fire

transmission in the WUI and ensure the creation of safer and more sustainable communities in

Mediterranean climates.  </p>

<p>The first step to solving this problem is by gaining a better understanding of fire behavior in these

spaces.   Fire modeling has been the foundation for fire mitigation since Dick Rothermel developed the first

easily replicable fire model in 1972.  His methodology was developed in the context of wildfires but his

understanding of the relationship between fire, fuel types, wind speed, and slope have remained universally

applicable (3).  In the context of the WUI, there are increasingly challenging factors that need to be taken into

account, namely the built environment and its relationship to surrounding vegetation.  The acquisition of

discrete data to model these factors is critical to a model’s success. Once a high fidelity model is created, it is

possible to provide localized, prescriptive changes to the form, structure, and composition of fuels in an area.

In light of this, our research aims to address the unique challenges of the WUI and provide tangible solutions

by utilizing high resolution, multispectral imagery, Airborne Lidar, vector-based fire modelling software,

community driven data collection, and site specific fuel modeling to inform comprehensive fire mitigation

strategies for communities in California and France with universal application to Mediterranean climates

around the world.</p>

<h1>II. Calibrating Our Fuel Model</h1>

<p>In the context of fire modeling, the WUI can be represented as a contiguous surface of patches of

homogenous fuel types, each patch having different fuel characteristics from its surrounding patches.  The

structure and composition of these fuel patches are critical variables that contribute to how wildfires

propagate in the WUI. Constructing our model will be a process of adjusting parameters in a segment mean

shift (SMS) algorithm and iterating through potential fuel models until we generate a high fidelity

representation of the fuel patch structure and composition in the study area.  Once properly calibrated to

the WUI in Mediterranean climates, an SMS model excels in its speed and potential for scalability.  However,

creating an SMS model requires a means of accuracy assessment for appropriate parameterization.  We turn

to crowdsourcing and stakeholder engagement to calibrate our fuel model to the Orinda Downs

neighborhood in Northern California and the XX neighborhood in some part of France.

The first stage of ground-truthing utilizes GIS classes at participating universities to manually digitize

the fuel structure in the study site.  Students use high-resolution orthoimagery to vectorize the fire model

structure, including buildings, vegetation, pavement, bodies of water, and other infrastructure.  For the

second stage of ground-truthing, we have developed a software that allows community

stakeholders—primarily homeowners—to confirm the composition of the homogenous fuel patches using a

webmap interface.  Homeowners with internet access can use the webmap to navigate to their home

address, and provide information about individual trees and structures in their own backyard; this includes

understory fire-ladder data that was previously unobtainable, despite being a crucial input to any fire spread

model.  In return, the homeowner becomes eligible to receive state of the art, prescriptive fire risk mitigation

consulting.</p>

<h1>III. Mitigating Risk in the WUI</h1>

<p>              The final model deliverable will use FARSITE and FlamMap spatial wildfire modeling software to

create wildfire spread rate and intensity simulations.  The simulations will integrate the SMS image analysis,

the crowdsourced discrete fuel data, and topographical and weather data to create spatial indexes of risk

within the study site. Potential mitigation practices will be evaluated by amending the fuel inputs to the

simulation to maximize effective firebreaks and defensible space at minimal cost and intrusion.  These

mitigation practices may include canopy thinning, ladder removal, creating defensible buffers around

buildings, among other procedures to counteract the effects of historical suppression.

To maximize the use-value and impact of our work, the results of the

risk analysis and mitigation option evaluations will be presented directly

to the homeowner via homeowners associations and direct

engagement.  Our project aims to establish a precedent of agency

among homeowners to abate fire risk around their own homes.  Fire

protection in the United States is blighted by the culture of the public

good, such that local government is the primary agent responsible for

risk abatement and abatement is naturally underprovided.  Our project

offers state of the art fire risk consulting directly to the homeowner to

overcome capital constraints that impede the paradigm shift of

infrastructure fire risk management to one of homeowner

responsibility.</p>

<h1>IV. Collaborative Research</h1>

<p>Fire risk is not an isolated issue and the potential risk to the lives and the properties of urban fringe

communities is devastating.  These realities are especially true in Mediterranean climates, and tackling these

challenges will require a collaborative approach that emanates best practices and ensures the accessibility of

leading research.  It is our goal to further this approach through a Californian and French research

collaborative that will enable us to share knowledge, build flexibility in our modeling to account for the

unique characteristics of our communities, and ultimately build an internationally defensible methodology

for WUI fire modeling, data collection, and homeowner driven fire mitigation.  </p>
